# Discord Bot Template (DJS v14)

This repository includes my personal bot template (all the base that I own and I am using for my current bots).




## Installation

1. Clone this project and/or download the ZIP file. 

2. Get your [Discord Bot Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and then copy/paste it into the **.env** file.

3. Get your [MongoDB Database URL](https://cloud.mongodb.com/) and then copy/paste it into the **.env** file.

**Note:**
If you don't have any MongoDB Database, leave it blank.

After that, install all dependencies with npm:
```bash
  npm i
```

**Dependencies (in case of any problems):**
